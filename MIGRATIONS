Create migration
    - Simple code to create dir + requisite files
    
Run migrations
    - Load list of local migrations
    - For each target host
        - connect
        - read list of applied migrations
    - Work out which migrations need to be applied based on host/applied migrations
    - Apply each migration
    
    - Problem: migration should look like SSH::Session so we get same helpers
    
    - After running migration code, mark as done.
